# ShudderPT
A basic prototype wrapper for ffmpeg streaming

Requires the most recent version of FFmpeg and FFprobe in it's local directory or a path var in your system.

Quickly change:
  - Audio birate
  - Video bitrate
  - Video resolution
  - Target URL
  
Pause transcoding without ending stream.
Set a seek time for a file.
Live burn-in for subtitles (.srt with identical filename in dir)
Feedback of frame transcoding performance.

Proof of concept for Shutter.
